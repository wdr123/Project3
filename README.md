# Project3
## How to get results
- I have generated output files for Bernoulli, Normal and Uniform Distribution, which you can check from the uniform_log.txt, normal_log.txt and bernoulli_log.txt.
- If you want to run the code and reproduce the results, simply running the files uniform_test.m, normal_test.m and bernoulli_test.m could generate the above log files.
## The final prediction result
* You can check the file result.txt which contains our final conclusion.
